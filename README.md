# Overview:
This project is a mouse that you can wear as a ring.<br /><br />
It uses the accelrometer and gyroscope in the Seeed nRF52840 Sense to control your mouse pointer and connects via bluetooth.<br />
Due to the incredible versitility of this chip set the possible functionality of this device seems almost endless.<br />

## Features:
- Currently connects via **bluetooth**<br />
- Bluetooth indicator light flashes blue until connected.<br />
- LED stays green while charging and shuts off when fully charged.<br />
- At battery 15% LED flashes red.<br />
- Device goes to sleep after 5 minutes to maintain battery life.<br />

## Usage:
Forward (left click) is mouse left click.<br />
Backwards (right click) is mouse right click.<br /><br />
Mouse moves by tilt.<br />
Scroll up and scroll down.<br /><br />
Hold back (right click) for 2 seconds puts the device to sleep.<br />
Hold back (right click) for 2 seconds wakes device up.<br />
